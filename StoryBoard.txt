Entry

You are trapped outside as you were traveling as a sudden and violent storm struck. Seeing a large, and presumably dry, manor, you knock on the door seeking shelter from the storm. no one answers and as you brace yourself to enter the storm again, you spot the key sticking out from under the mat. You’re now inside of the entry room. It is a reasonably large room, with some old chairs and a coat rack on the west wall, as you have entered from the south. The walls are upholstered and, and there is an ornate chandelier that has seen better days hanging from the ceiling. There is a window to the south next to the door, which is the rooms only source of light.
